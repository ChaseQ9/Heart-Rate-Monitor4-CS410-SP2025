    <h1>Challenges and Issues</h1>
    <p>
      We encountered various issues when implementing our project, but the biggest one was
      getting the sensor to read properly. There was not much documentation on the heart rate
      sensor we used, so we had to figure out how it worked on our own. After many hours of
      tinkering, we concluded that our sensor might be defective.

      From our understanding, the sensor provided reads heart rate using a technique called photo plethysmography (PPG). Our 
      sensor implements this with an led placed in front of a light sensor. When a finger is placed between the sensor and the led, the amount of 
      light received by the sensor will fluctuate due to changes in blood volume. Each fluctuation is interpreted as a singular heart beat. In our 
      implementation, we took the number of fluctuations in 10,000 millis or 10 seconds divided it by 10 then multiplied it by 60 to get a bpm. 
      However,our sensor consistently returned a raw analog value of 4095,regardless of lighting conditions. There were no fluctuations no matter 
      the test conditions we put the sensor in. Additionally, we discovered the LED component was not functioning, which left us unsure of what the 
      sensor was even detecting. We tried several test codes and scoured various online forums, many of which had users reporting that their sensors 
      came in broken or with similar issues and unfortunately, it appears that we received a faulty unit as well.

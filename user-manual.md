## ðŸ’“ Heart Rate Monitor - End-User Manual
Welcome! This guide will walk you through how to **set up, build, run and use** the Heart Rate Monitor project created for CS410-SP2025.

## What You Need
- ESP32 board 
- Pulse Rate Monitor Module
- Active Buzzer
- Passive Buzzer
- USB cable to connect ESP32 to your computer
- Python(Python 3) installed on your computer
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Visual Studio Code (Recommended IDE)

## How to set up
1. Download the Project
Download the project files from our GitHub repository (Either clone or download ZIP and extract it locally)
2. Install Python Dependencies
Install Flask using pip: "pip install flask"

## How to build it
Use the Arduino IDE to upload the project.ino file in your ESP32 board:
1. Open project.ino in the Arduino IDE.
2. Select your board type (e.g., "ESP32 Dev Module").
3. Select the correct COM port.
4. Click Upload to flash the ESP32. 
5. You may need to modify the threshold value in project.ino depending on your pulse sensor's sensitivity.

## How to run it
Run the Backend Server
- In the terminal, run: "python/python3 server.py"
- Once started, the server will provide a local address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000)
- Copy and paste that into your web browser.
- Keep the terminal running while using the application.

## How to use it
1. Place your finger between the LED and sensor on the ESP32.
2. Do this in a dimly or darkly lit room for best results.
3. Wait a few seconds for signal detection.
4. Your current heart rate (BPM) will appear on the website in real time.

## Troubleshooting
### Problem / Solution 
1. No heart rate detected
=> Ensure finger placement is correct, check lighting and be patient.
2. Server doesn't start
=> Make sure Flask is installed and use python/python3 server.py
3. Website shows no data
=> Confirm ESP32 is sending data; check wiring and serial connection.
4. Sensor too sensitive or noisy: Adjust the threshold in project.ino based on your sensor sensitivity.

## Notes
- This project does not store any personal health data.
- All readings are processed in real time and are not logged or saved.
- For technical background, please check the issue page on our website for more details on how PPG or photo-plethysmography works.
